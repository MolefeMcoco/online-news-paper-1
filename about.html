                    <p>We produce media that incorporates a “community journalism approach”; where content is informed by the needs of the community. In other words, media that gives a voice to communities as opposed to that of authorities.

                      <li><em>Social Justice:</em> Media that challenges racism, sexism and xenophobia.</li>
                      <li><em>Access and Participation:</em> Media that provide community access to means of production, including equipment and training opportunities.</li>
